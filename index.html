        <p>I graduated from San Diego State University (go Aztecs!) with a Bachelors of Science in Accounting. 
          I am a Certified Public Accountant and have worked for various public and private companies
          for 10 years. Throughout those 10 years, I have worked on numerous projects and collaborated with other
          departments.

        <p>I am excited to apply my previous experience and the technical software development skills that I have learned at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">
           Thinkful.</a> I hope to have a positive impact on the future success of a company and its customers. 
           Web development has become a crucial part for so many businesses. I look foward
           to helping a company fulfill that need.
