        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I graduated from San Diego State University (go Aztecs!) with a Bachelors of Science in Accounting. 
          I am a Certified Public Accountant and have worked for various public and private companies
          for 10 years. Throughout those 10 years, I have worked on numerous projects and collaborated with other
          departments.
        </p>
        <p>I am excited to apply the technical software development skills that I have learned at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">
           Thinkful,</a> along with my previous experience, to have a positive impact on the 
           future success of a company and its customers. Web development is a crucial part of so many businesses. I look foward
           to helping a company fulfill that need.
